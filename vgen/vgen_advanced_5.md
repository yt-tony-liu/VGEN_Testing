## Prompt
please finish this module according to the specification
```verilog
// This is an FSM 
// It outputs 1 when 1 is received for signals a and b irrespetive of their order, either simultaneously or non-simultaneously.
module abro( input clk, input reset,input a, input b, output z );
parameter IDLE = 0,
SA = 1,
SB = 2,
SAB = 3;
reg [1:0] cur_state,next_state;
// Update state or reset on every clock edge
// Output z depends only on the state SAB
// The output z is high when cur_state is SAB
// cur_state is reset to IDLE when reset is high. Otherwise, it takes value of next_state.
// Next state generation logic:
// If cur_state is IDLE and a and b are both high, state changes to SAB
// If cur_state is IDLE, and a is high, state changes to SA
// If cur_state is IDLE, and b is high, state changes to SB
// If cur_state is SA, and b is high, state changes to SAB
// If cur_state is SB, and a is high, state changes to SAB
// If cur_state is SAB, state changes to IDLE
// Implements an FSM in Verilog
```
## Reply
Here is the completed Verilog module abro that implements the specified FSM:
```verilog
// This is an FSM 
// It outputs 1 when 1 is received for signals a and b irrespective of their order, either simultaneously or non-simultaneously.
module abro(
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input a,
    input b,
    output reg z
);
    parameter IDLE = 2'b00,
              SA = 2'b01,
              SB = 2'b10,
              SAB = 2'b11;

    reg [1:0] cur_state, next_state;

    // State transition logic
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            cur_state <= IDLE; // Reset to IDLE state
        else
            cur_state <= next_state; // Update to the next state
    end

    // Next state generation logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (cur_state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (a && b)
                    next_state = SAB; // Transition to SAB if both a and b are high
                else if (a)
                    next_state = SA; // Transition to SA if only a is high
                else if (b)
                    next_state = SB; // Transition to SB if only b is high
                else
                    next_state = IDLE; // Remain in IDLE if neither a nor b is high
            end
            SA: begin
                if (b)
                    next_state = SAB; // Transition to SAB if b becomes high
                else
                    next_state = SA; // Remain in SA if b is not high
            end
            SB: begin
                if (a)
                    next_state = SAB; // Transition to SAB if a becomes high
                else
                    next_state = SB; // Remain in SB if a is not high
            end
            SAB: begin
                next_state = IDLE; // Transition back to IDLE
            end
            default: next_state = IDLE; // Default to IDLE
        endcase
    end

    // Output logic
    always @(*) begin
        z = (cur_state == SAB); // Output z is high only in state SAB
    end
endmodule
```
Explanation:
State Transition Logic:

The cur_state is updated on the positive edge of the clock or reset.
If reset is high, the FSM resets to the IDLE state.
Next State Logic:

The next_state is determined based on the cur_state and the inputs a and b:
From IDLE:
Transition to SAB if both a and b are high.
Transition to SA if only a is high.
Transition to SB if only b is high.
From SA:
Transition to SAB if b becomes high.
From SB:
Transition to SAB if a becomes high.
From SAB:
Always transition back to IDLE.
Output Logic:

The output z is asserted (1) only when the cur_state is SAB.
This implementation ensures the FSM behaves as specified, recognizing the sequence of signals a and b irrespective of their order.
