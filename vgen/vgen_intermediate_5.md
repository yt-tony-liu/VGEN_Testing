# [vgen_intermediate_5](https://github.com/shailja-thakur/VGen/blob/main/prompts-and-testbenches/intermediate5/prompt3_shift-left-rotate.v)
## Prompt
please finish this module according to the specification
```verilog
// This is a shift left and rotate operation
module left_rotate(input clk,input reset,input [2:0] amount,input [7:0] data,input load,output reg [7:0] out);
// when load is high, load data to out
// when load is low, shift left and rotate the register out by amount bits
```
## Reply
Here is the completed Verilog module left_rotate that implements the shift left and rotate operation:
```verilog
// This is a shift left and rotate operation
module left_rotate(
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [2:0] amount,
    input [7:0] data,
    input load,
    output reg [7:0] out
);
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) 
            out <= 8'b0; // Reset the output to 0
        else if (load) 
            out <= data; // Load data into out when load is high
        else 
            out <= {out[7-amount:0], out[7:8-amount]}; // Shift left and rotate by 'amount' bits
    end
endmodule
```
Explanation:
Reset Logic:

When reset is high, the output out is reset to 0.
Load Logic:

When load is high, the input data is loaded directly into the output out.
Shift Left and Rotate:

When load is low, the out register is shifted left by amount bits, and the most significant bits that are shifted out are rotated back into the least significant bits.
This is achieved using concatenation: {out[7-amount:0], out[7:8-amount]}.
This implementation ensures the module behaves as specified, performing a shift left and rotate operation when load is low and loading data when load is high.
