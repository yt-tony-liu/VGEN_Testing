## Prompt
please finish this module according to the specification
```
// This is a half adder.
module half_adder( 
input a, b,
output cout, sum );
// A half adder adds two bits and produces a sum and carry-out.
```
## Reply
Here is the completed Verilog module half_adder that implements a half adder:
```
// This is a half adder.
module half_adder( 
    input a, b,
    output cout, sum
);
    assign sum = a ^ b;  // Sum is the XOR of inputs a and b
    assign cout = a & b; // Carry-out is the AND of inputs a and b
endmodule
```
Explanation:
The sum is calculated using the XOR (^) operation, which adds the two bits without considering the carry.
The carry-out (cout) is calculated using the AND (&) operation, which determines if both bits are 1.
