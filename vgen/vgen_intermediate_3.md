# [vgen_intermediate_3](https://github.com/shailja-thakur/VGen/blob/main/prompts-and-testbenches/intermediate3/prompt3_lfsr.v)
## Prompt
please finish this module according to the specification
```verilog
// This is a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3
module lfsr( 
input clk,
input reset,
output [4:0] q
); 
reg [4:0] r_reg;
wire [4:0] r_next;
wire feedback_value;
// on reset set the value of r_reg to 1
// otherwise assign r_next to r_reg
// assign the xor of bit positions 2 and 4 of r_reg to feedback_value
// concatenate feedback value with 4 MSBs of r_reg and assign it to r_next
// assign r_reg to the output q
```
## Reply
Here is the completed Verilog module lfsr that implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3:
```verilog
// This is a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3
module lfsr( 
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output [4:0] q
); 
    reg [4:0] r_reg;
    wire [4:0] r_next;
    wire feedback_value;

    // Compute feedback value as XOR of bit positions 2 and 4 (0-indexed)
    assign feedback_value = r_reg[4] ^ r_reg[2];

    // Compute the next state by concatenating feedback_value with 4 MSBs of r_reg
    assign r_next = {feedback_value, r_reg[4:1]};

    // Sequential logic to update r_reg
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            r_reg <= 5'b00001; // On reset, set r_reg to 1
        else
            r_reg <= r_next; // Otherwise, update r_reg with r_next
    end

    // Assign the current state to the output
    assign q = r_reg;
endmodule
```
Explanation:
Feedback Value: The feedback value is computed as the XOR of bit positions 5 and 3 (0-indexed as 4 and 2 in Verilog).
Next State: The next state (r_next) is formed by concatenating the feedback value with the 4 most significant bits of the current state (r_reg[4:1]).
Reset Logic: On reset, the register is initialized to 5'b00001 to ensure the LFSR starts correctly.
Sequential Update: On every positive clock edge, the register is updated with the next state.
Output: The current state of the register (r_reg) is assigned to the output q.
### Comment
I have no idea what this is but it seems to follow every spec.
