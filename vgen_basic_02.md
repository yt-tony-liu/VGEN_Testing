## Prompt
please finish this module according to the specification
```
// This is a module that implements an AND gate
module and_gate( 
input a, 
input b, 
output out );
```
## Reply
Here is the completed Verilog module and_gate that implements an AND gate:
```
// This is a module that implements an AND gate
module and_gate( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out 
);
    assign out = a & b; // Perform bitwise AND operation on inputs 'a' and 'b'
endmodule
```
This module uses a continuous assignment statement (assign) to compute the logical AND of the inputs a and b and assign the result to the output out.
